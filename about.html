	<p>Hello. My name is Peter and I want to learn web design. I’ve always been technology oriented. My father was in IT and my mother worked for Adobe so there were always a lot of computers around the house. Some dads teach their kid how to throw a fastball. Mine taught me how to overclock a Pentium II. I went to college and got a degree in Computer Systems Technologies. But I noticed I liked the programing courses more than the networking courses. So I went back to get a degree in Computer Science. That’s when I noticed I liked programing more than college. Since then I’ve been learning coding on my own. It is now time to take my quest to another level. Thank you.</p>
